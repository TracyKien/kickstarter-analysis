# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This analysis was performed to help Louise, a playwriter, determine whether a crowdfunding campaign for her play would be successful. Performing an analysis on serveral thousand crowdfunding projects helped uncover trends that might help her determine the best route to take with her crowdfunding project.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One takeaway from this analysis was seeing when the best time to launch her crowdfunding project would be. By compiling imformation for different theater crowdfunding projects, the best time to launch a crowdfunding project is late spring and the worst time is wintertime. The most ideal time for Louise to launch her crowdfunding is at the end of April. Refer to the chart below for examples.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By examining the outcomes of different crowdfunding goals, Louise can determine what to set her own goal at. The goals with the highest percentage of success were the ones that had lower set goals. As the amount for the goals went up, the percentage for failure increased. However, some crowdfunding goals proved to be successful around the 35,000-40,000 mark. Refer to the chart below for examples.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
