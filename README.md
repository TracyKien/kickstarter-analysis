# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This analysis was performed to help Louise, a playwriter, determine whether a crowdfunding campaign for her play would be successful. Performing an analysis on serveral thousand crowdfunding projects helped uncover trends that might help her determine the best route to take with her crowdfunding project.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One takeaway from this analysis was seeing when the best time to launch her crowdfunding project would be. By compiling imformation for different theater crowdfunding projects, the best time to launch a crowdfunding project is late spring and the worst time is wintertime. The most ideal time for Louise to launch her crowdfunding is at the end of April. Refer to the chart below for examples.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By examining the outcomes of different crowdfunding goals, Louise can determine what to set her own goal at. The goals with the highest percentage of success were the ones that had lower set goals. As the amount for the goals went up, the percentage for failure increased. However, some crowdfunding goals proved to be successful around the 35,000-40,000 mark. Refer to the chart below for examples.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There weren't many challenges and difficulties that I encountered other than finding the time to spend on the course work and getting familiarized with the formulas in Excel. Once I started to get going with everything, it all seemed to come together and 'click'.


## Results
- Two conclusions that can be determined about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that people were more willing to support theater crowdfunding events in the springtime than in the wintertime. You can also see that crowdfunds will either fail or succeed. There is no canceling it once it's launched.

- One thing that can be determined about the Outcomes based on Goals is that the lower the target, the more people are willing to support the crowdfund. As the goal rose, so did the potential for failure.

- Some limitations of this dataset that I noticed was that it only has data up to the year 2017 and it is now 2021 so the data is a little outdated if Louise were wanting the information to start a crowdfund for the current year.

- Some other charts and graphs that could be created based on this dataset are:

  *You can use the dataset to determine which Parent Category has the best crowdfunding success rate.
  *You can break it down even further to determine which Subcategory out of each Parent Category is the most successful.
  *Create a graph to see what the highest amount raise vs the lowest amount raise is.
